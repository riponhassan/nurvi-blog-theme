Dragon Chicken is made using boneless chicken breast pieces. Here I have taken only one single chicken breast and sliced it into two parts. Then cut them into thin strips around half inch width. Now add half teaspoon red chilly paste, ginger garlic paste, around 1/4 teaspoon green chilli paste, 2 tablespoon corn flour, 2 tablespoon beaten egg and salt as per your taste. Mix them nicely so that all the chicken strips are get evenly coated. Cover and let them marinated for 5 to 6 minutes to absorb the flavours.

2. Frying the chicken
Heat a kadai or small deep vessel pan with enough cooking oil under medium heat flame. When the oil become hot lower the gas flame to low and carefully add the chicken strips one by one into the hot oil. Fry them until become crisp golden from all sides. Remove them on a absorbent paper to absorb any excess oil.

3. Stir frying
Heat a non stick pan or Chinese wok with one tablespoon oil under medium flame heat gas fire. Add the bell peppers, capsicum, onion and pieces of whole red chilly. Stir fry them for few seconds in high flame heat. Then add chopped onion, chopped ginger, garlic, green chilly paste and cashew nuts. Stir fry them for one minute.
Now add red chilly paste, red chilly sauce, tomato sauce and give them a good mix. 
Add some water and cook the sauces for few seconds. Then add soya sauce, white pepper powder, salt and madras curry powder and cook further for few seconds. Now add the fried chicken strips and mix well with the sauces so that the chicken pieces are get well coated with them.
Pour 2 tablespoon corn flour slurry over the chicken mixture and mix well. Finally sprinkle some chopped spring onions and give a final mix. Remove on a serving plate and serve hot.
